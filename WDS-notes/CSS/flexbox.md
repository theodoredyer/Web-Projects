### display: flex;
- Items in a flex container scale in size relative to eachother with window resizing. 
- We can style items just from the container. 

#### Row vs column. 
- Row and column layouts
- Main axis goes the same direction as our layout, and we style the layout based on the axes.
- To style elements on the main axis, use justify-content: flex-start; justify-content: space-between, space-around etc.
- To sort vertically, use align-items: flex-start, etc.

### Random notable features.
- flex-shrink: 0; makes the item not shrink with window resizing like others will.
